title: ICLR Poster Session

I presented our poster ["ColPali: Efficient Document Retrieval with Vision Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01449) at ICLR !


The original paper starts to be a bit dated as it was released in June, but I decided to create a poster that stays true to the original work. For all the novelties, follow me on X!
