After pretraining at EPFL, Imperial College and as a research data scientist at Illuin Technology, I am now in my academic finetuning phase as a PhD student at CentraleSupélec (Université Paris Saclay), as well as a lead research scientist at Illuin Technology, a French tech startup specialized in industrial NLP.


My research focuses on industrial applications of large language models, with published works in instruction model evaluation, bilingual LLM pretraining, as well as privacy ML and information retrieval for RAG use cases.


Don't hesitate to contact me to talk about my work or potential collaborations or talks !
