I truly enjoy sharing knowledge with others and had the opportunity to work as a teaching assistant in various Bachelor and Master level courses
during my time at EPFL. No real logic here, but I TA'd for the following courses:
- Newtonian Mechanics (3 years)
- Thermodynamics
- Introduction to Quantum Mechanics
- Analysis I
- Programming in C
- Advanced Programming in C++
- Applied Machine Learning

Most recently during my PhD, I assisted Pierre Colombo in his Natural Language Processing courses at ENSAE and CentraleSupéléc.
I also was a speaker at the Paris GenAI School in 2024, where I gave a lecture on the topic of language model pretraining.

I also supervised students on various projects, ranging from Tech for Good Initiatives with UNESCO, or Health ML Hackathons, 
to longer term internship supervision and managing student research projects.

I had the opportunity to give a few guest lectures on NLP and ML Privacy at various institutions, and I am always open to new opportunities to share knowledge and learn from others !
